cargo project steps:
---------------------
    cargo new satya --bin  ===> This will create sample hello world project
    cargo run ===> will run and create all the dependecy and execute code and provides o/p
    cargo build --release  ===> This will create release build
    cargo run --bin hello   ===> Use this if you have 2 binary in ur project. If u want 2 binary inside cargo put ur             other binary inside src/bin folder and run the above command.

    We can build a project using cargo build.
    We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
    We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
    Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug             directory.

    NOTE: use repetedly cargo check either ur program compile successfully or not.

rustc -C prefer-dynamic=yes 1.rs  ===> Run this methode for dynamic link but after that binary is not running.
